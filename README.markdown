SC Query Autocomplete
=======

An autocompletion framework to complement the SproutCore datastore framework.

- `QAC.ScqlGuesser`: The root controller. Text goes in, a stack of query tokens and a list of next-up guesses comes out. Used by `QAC.QueryFieldView`; you can also implement your own view by consuming the `currentText`, `tokenStack` and `guesses` properties. When you need to snag the query's full text out, get the `fullText` property.
- `QAC.AttributeGuesser`: Suggests attribute autocompletions, including for related records. Used by the ScqlGuesser class when the user is entering an attribute.
- QAC.QueryFieldView: A view which manages the text entry, token display and autocompletions generated by `QAC.ScqlGuesser`.

Includes an extension to SC.Record to facilitate class-level attribute introspection.

Basic Example
=======

MyApp.QueryView = QAC.QueryFieldView.extend({
  controller: QAC.ScqlGuesser.extend({
    recordType: MyApp.MyRecordType
  })
});
