SC Query Autocomplete
=======

An autocompletion framework to complement the SproutCore datastore framework.

QueryAutocomplete.ScqlGuesser: The root controller. Text goes in, a stack of query tokens and a list of next-up guesses comes out.

QueryAutocomplete.AttributeGuesser: Suggests attribute autocompletions, including for related records. Used by the ScqlGuesser class when the user is entering an attribute.

QueryAutocomplete.QueryFieldView: A view which manages the text entry, token display and autocompletions generated by QueryAutocomplete.ScqlGuesser.

Includes an extension to SC.Record to facilitate class-level attribute introspection.
